This project involved designing and implementing an Investment Calculator in C++ that allows users to estimate the growth of their savings over time, both with and without monthly deposits. The program prompts the user for key financial inputs, performs compound interest calculations, and outputs two formatted reports to help users compare different savings strategies. Through clear code organization, modular functions, and formatted output, I focused on making the tool intuitive and user-friendly. I am particularly proud of how I structured the code for readability and maintainability, using descriptive variable names, breaking the logic into manageable functions, and keeping the user interface clear. The project also reinforced my understanding of user input handling, formatted console output, and object-oriented programming—all valuable skills that will benefit me in future coursework and software development. One of the most challenging parts was implementing the compound interest calculations for both scenarios and ensuring the reports were accurate and clearly formatted. Managing floating-point values within nested loops for years and months, as well as formatting output with tools like iomanip, required careful attention and some trial and error.

I noticed some slight errors in my program that still need to be fixed, which highlighted the importance of improving my debugging skills. Strengthening my debugging process—by systematically isolating issues, using diagnostic output, and utilizing debugging tools—will help me identify and resolve errors more efficiently in future work. To overcome the challenges I faced, I broke down problems into smaller steps, tested my logic with known values, and referenced C++ documentation, online tutorials, and discussion forums for extra support. Moving forward, I plan to continue leveraging official documentation, coding forums like Stack Overflow, and various debugging tools as part of my support network. . Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that not only enhanced my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of maintainability, adaptability, and thorough testing in software development.
